1. Understand Linked Lists:
	Q. Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).
	  Singly Linked List:
	  Description: A linear collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
	  Advantages:
		Dynamic size.
		Efficient insertions and deletions.
	  Disadvantages:
		No efficient access to elements by index.
		Extra memory for storing references.

	  Doubly Linked List:
	  Description: Each node contains data and two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node.
	  Advantages:
		Allows traversal in both directions.
		Efficient insertions and deletions.
	  Disadvantages:
		Requires more memory for storing two references.
		No efficient access to elements by index.


4. Analysis:
	Q. Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
	  Time Complexity:
	  Add Operation: O(n), traverse to the end to add a new task.
	  Search Operation: O(n), linear search through the linked list.
	  Traverse Operation: O(n), iterate through all nodes.
	  Delete Operation: O(n), find the task and adjust pointers.
	
	Q. Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data .
	   Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically without the need to declare a fixed size.
	   Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements does not require shifting elements, making these operations faster in some cases.
	   Memory Usage: No need for a contiguous block of memory, which can be beneficial for memory utilization.
