1. Understand Search Algorithms:
	Q. Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
	   Linear Search:
           	Scans each element of the list one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends.
                Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

           Binary Search:
		Efficiently finds an element by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It requires the list to be sorted.
		Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

4. Analysis:
	Q. Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
	   Time Complexity:
	   	Linear Search: O(n), It scans each element in the list one by one.
           	Binary Search: O(log n) , It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, requiring a sorted list.

	Q. Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
	   Linear Search:
		Use it for small datasets.
		Suitable when the list is unsorted or changes frequently, making sorting impractical.
	   Binary Search:
		Use it for larger datasets.
		Requires the list to be sorted, but provides much faster search times once sorted.
	   By choosing the appropriate search algorithm based on the dataset size and order, you can optimize search performance in your library management system.
