1. Understand the Problem:
	Q. Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
	   Data Structures and Algorithms are essential in handling large inventories due to several reasons. They are:
	   Performance: Efficient and proper data structures and algorithms ensure quick access, modification, and storage of inventory data, which is essential for real-time applications.
	   Speed: Algorithms help in performing operations like searching, sorting, inserting, and deleting efficiently. This is vital in an inventory system where operations need to be performed rapidly.
           Memory Management: Efficient use of memory helps in reducing costs and ensuring that the system can handle large datasets.
           Scalability: They ensure the system can handle growing amounts of data without slowing down.
	   
	Q. Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
           The type of data structures suitable for this problem are:
	   ArrayList: Suitable for dynamic arrays where elements can be accessed quickly via indices. However, it may not be optimal for frequent insertions and deletions.
	   HashMap: Provides fast access, insertion, and deletion operations (average-case O(1) time complexity). It's suitable for cases where quick lookup by key (e.g., productId) is required.
	   LinkedList: Useful for efficient insertion and deletion, but has O(n) complexity for searching.

4. Analysis:
	Q. Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
	   Time Complexity of each operation:
	   Add Product: O(1) ,inserting into HashMap.
           Update Product: O(1), updating an existing entry in a HashMap.
	   Delete Product: O(1), removing an entry from a HashMap.
	
	Q. Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
	   Rehashing: To minimize the impact of rehashing, choose an initial capacity and load factor that suit the expected size of the inventory.
	   Concurrency: For a multi-threaded environment, consider using ConcurrentHashMap to handle concurrent access and modification efficiently.
	   Bulk Operations: For operations involving multiple products, consider batch processing to minimize the overhead of repeated operations.
